# Spielebuch
A Meteor package that makes writing interactive books very easy.

# Core concepts
Interactive gameobjects are created while writing text. The author can create rules and effects and add those to gameobjects, scenes or the whole story.
Effects are a set of rules. A rule is a key-value-pair.
E.g.:
'Firedamage' and '-40'
This rule reduces the firedamage by 40 on the object/scene/story it affects.

Properies are always set by rules.

For more information take a look at the tutorials.
