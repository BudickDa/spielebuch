# Spielebuch
A Meteor package that makes writing interactive books very easy.


# Core concepts
Interactive gameobjects are created while writing text. The author can create rules and effects and add those to gameobjects, scenes or the whole story.
Effects are a set of rules. A rule is a key-value-pair.
E.g.:
'Firedamage' and '-40'
This rule reduces the firedamage by 40 on the object/scene/story it affects.

Properties are always set by rules.

For more information take a look at the tutorials in [/book](book).

# Dual License
This package is licensed under GPL V3. This means, if you create an application with this package it has to be open source too.
For more information look at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html

For using this package in a proprietary or closed source application please contact daniel@budick.eu. 


# Language
This is a german project, this means the examples are written in german for now. I promise there will be a example in english soon. 
And when I think about it, it is one more reason to put the UI into its own package.


# Contribution
This not even an alpha version. Please do not send pull request/bug reports and be patient for now.
If this goes into beta I hopefully will have created an API that supports addons in form of other packages can be written and used in a gamebook.
This where you can start coding your own package and hit me with bug reports, ideas, etc, in by generating issues.
If you want to make your own thing, just fork and go into your own direction, but please respect the GPL at all time.
